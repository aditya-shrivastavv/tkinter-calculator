# Tkinter Calculator

In this Project I tried building a simple Calculator 
using python's inbuilt tkinter library.
I have tried development for the very first time, 
by doing this project I learned a bit about development.





## Tech Stack

**Client:** Python, tkinter Library




## Run Locally

 Runing the project Locally is actually very easy, 
 you just need a python development environment in your system.
 Just run the file `main.py` and play around
